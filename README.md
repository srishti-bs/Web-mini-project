# Web-mini-project
The Online Pharmacy Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL that simplifies the process of browsing and purchasing medicines online. It provides users with an easy-to-use platform to view available medicines, add items to a cart, and place orders efficiently.

This project includes essential modules such as user authentication, product management, cart handling, order processing, and an admin panel for inventory management. It demonstrates the practical application of full-stack web development concepts and was developed as part of the Web Technologies mini project.
